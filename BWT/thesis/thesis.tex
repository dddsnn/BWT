%			penalty
%		-new penalty: new symbols in the right side that didn't appear in the

%			symbols (>10?) will have (significantly) longer codes as there are
%			more symbols to encode. higher value mtf codes are usually sparse,
%			but can't be sure how many zeros will remain after reordering
%			curve fitting sparse: assume there will be the same amount of
%			zeros after reordering. give zeros the same length as their
%			neighbors, even though there can't be a huffman code with those
%			code lengths and that many symbols 
%	-describe things needed for an ideal badness metric (new penalty,entropy
%		len, weighting?), then give approximations
%	-another point of non-optimality: which transition to choose as a starting
%		point? need to break up the baddest transition
%	-need need a new penalty dict that is specific for the symbol being encoded
%		i.e. what is the average code for e.g. 'a' given that the minimum
%		possible is n
%	-new penalty predictor that gives the average code for a specific symbol
% 		that is new in the block, with a given mimimum
%	-much higher compression benefit when sorting all columns instead of just
%		the first one -> a lot of the compression benefit comes from the higher
% 		order transitions
%	-after comparing predictions with actual values, do another pass of
%		calculating transitions, but pass a compensation summand that will be
%		added to every prediction, so that the average is 0

The reason Burrows-Wheeler based compression algorithms are so effective is that
the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) creates sequences of symbols that appear in
the same context. If the input file is suitable for context-based
compression, these sequences will consist of only a few distinct symbols with
lots of repetition, leading to many small numbers in the MTF code.

But any time the context changes, in the Burrows-Wheeler code a new sequence
begins that is in general not related to the previous one. This incurs some
overwork\cite{bitner1979heuristics} for the MTF coder as it has to adapt to the
new context, resulting in larger codes for symbols that were not requested in
the previous sequence.

The idea behind using different sort orders is to order the contexts in a way
that reduces the overwork caused by a transition from one context to the next,
resulting in lower MTF codes and higher compression.

In order to find a suitable reordering, you need to do the BWT on the input data
to get the context blocks, rank all possible transitions between blocks with a
cost metric and find a sort order based on the costs. Finding the ordering with
given costs is an instance of the traveling salesman problem, where the nodes
are the context blocks and the distances between them are the cost of the
transition.

\section{Chapin's Metrics}

aeiou

Chapin uses four different cost metrics, three of which I have reimplemented for
comparison with my own metric.\footnote{The fourth uses the Kullback-Leibler
distance, but is unclear about how to deal with zeros in the PMF.} All of them
analyze the histograms of symbol appearances for every context block and try to
give a measure of how similar they are. That means: For each context block
(generated by BW encoding the input with the natural sort order), make a
histogram of the number of symbol appearances in that block, i.e.
a mapping from each possible symbol to the number of times it appears in that
block.

In Chapin's first metric, two histograms are compared by taking the
logarithm\footnote{Chapin doesn't specify to which base. In my implementation,
I use the natural logarithm.} of all of the symbol counts, calculating, for each
symbol, the differences between the logarithms in both histograms and summing up
the squares of all of the differences. The result is used as a measure of
similarity between the two contexts.

For the second metric, the symbol counts from the histograms are written to a
list in decreasing order. The cost of a transition is the number of
inversions\cite{sleator1985amortized} between the two corresponding lists.

The third metric is just the logarithm of the second metric.\footnote{Again, no
base was specified, I use the natural logarithm.}

-not comparable with my data because of variations in tsp and the actual
compression algo

\section{The Badness Metric}

My own metric attempts to give a value denoting how bad any given transition is
and is hence called the badness metric.\footnote{Only after I had given it that
name and used it all over my code did it come to my mind that assigning a
badness value is really the purpose of any such metric.} Other than Chapin's
metrics, it doesn't operate on the BW code, but on the MTF code it generates
and so, in a sense, is ``closer to the compression''.


\subsection{Ugly LKH}

The badness values generated are not necessarily symmetric, i.e. the badness of
the transition from context x to y is not necessarily the badness of y to x.
This has the unfortunate consequence that I now need a heuristic solver for the
asymmetrical traveling salesman problem, which is much harder to find than a
heuristic for the ``ordinary'' symmetrical TSP. I finally found
LKH\cite{helsgaun2000lkh}\footnote{http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/},
which can approximate solutions to the asymmetrical TSP. Unfortunately, it can
not handle floating point input, so I have to do some ugly scaling.

%-describe and give error bounds

\subsection{Basic Operation}

To explain the badness metric, I need to introduce the partial MTF code that
will be used on appropriate parts of the BW code. This is not absolutely
necessary to get the actual badness value, but useful to understand why the
metric does what it does.

The partial MTF differs from the regular MTF code only in that you start with an
empty alphabet and encode an escape code (I will use -1) anytime a symbol
appears that isn't already in the alphabet.
E.g., the ASCII encoded string ``aabcab'' encoded (byte-wise) with regular MTF
would yield \([97, 0, 98, 99, 2, 2]\), encoded with partial MTF it would be
\([-1, 0, -1, -1, 2, 2]\).

Of course this means that it can't be decoded anymore, but we only need it to
illustrate the operation of the metric.

To compute the badness value of a transition, the metric needs the context
blocks for both sides of the transition, i.e. the BW code belonging to the
symbol that's being transitioned from or to, respectively.

It then produces the partial MTF code of the destination block (the right
side), and of the concatenation of the source and destination block (combined
partial MTF).
So it  basically pretends that the two blocks were sorted one after the other,
and then attempts to give an indication of how bad this would be for the
compression.

Looking at the partial MTF code of the destination side of the transition, the
metric assumes that all recurring codes (i.e. those that aren't escape codes)
are not interesting for the purposes of ranking transitions, as they would be
the same no matter what comes before or after.\footnote{This assumtion is not
actually correct, as I will explain in the next section.}

What is of interest, are the escape codes on the right side of the transition,
because this is where what has previously been encoded can influence the MTF
codes in the final result. When the input file is finally encoded with the
(full) MTF, each of the escape symbols will be replaced by an actual code. How
high those codes are, determines the compression lost by the transition between
contexts.

The metric compiles the ideal MTF alphabet the left side can ``leave'' for the
right side.

E.g., the first code in the partial MTF of the right side is necessarily an
escape code. It would be ideal, if the last symbol of the left side were the
first symbol of the right side. That would mean that it is at the front of the
alphabet when the transition occurrs, and so that first escape code would, in
the full MTF be encoded as a 0 (and smaller codes are better). The ideal full
MTF code for the next escape code is 1 (since the code 0 in the alphabet has
already been taken by whatever symbol came before it) etc.
%example? pseudo code?

The metric can then compare the ideal codes with the actual codes in the
combined partial MTF at the positions where the escape symbols are in the
partial MTF of just the right side. The differences between actual code and
ideal code are summed up to form the badness of the transition.

What can also happen is that the part of the combined partial MTF belonging to
the right side still contains escape codes. This means that the symbols encoded
by them do not appear in the left side of the transition at all. In this case,
the metric assumes the best possible code for that symbol, which is equal to the
number of escape symbols in the combined partial MTF up to that point (i.e. the
metric assumes that whatever context block ends up preceding the left side
of this transition will leave an ideal alphabet).

\subsection{Ideality, under some circumstances}

The metric assumes that the partial MTF codes of the right side of the
transition that are not escape codes don't change no matter the order that is
finally selected, and thus aren't interesting. This assumption is incorrect
since, when a different reordering is selected, the BW code of the context
blocks is also reordered, and so the generated MTF code will (probably) be
different. For Chapin's metrics, this doesn't matter because they only care
which symbol occurrs how often, not in which order.

So we'll consider a slightly different problem than finding an ideal global
reordering: instead of looking for a sort order by which the entire BW table
will be sorted, we look for an order by which only the first column of the BW
table will be sorted, all other columns will use the natural order (which was
used to generate the context blocks that are fed to the metric).

This is equivalent to finding a reordering of the fixed context blocks the
metric deals with. This means that recurring symbols in the partial MTF never
change, no matter what order is chosen for the first column, and so the
assumption the metric makes is true.

Let's further assume that we have two oracles that know which reordering will
finally be selected. When the metric encounters an escape symbol in the right
side of the combined partial MTF (i.e. a symbol that appears in the right side
doesn't appear in the left side), it has to assume the best possible code for
lack of information. The first oracle can provide the actual codes that will be
at those positions in the final computed order.

The second oracle can provide the codeword lengths in bits of the entropy coder
for every MTF code appearing in the final reordered and MTF encoded file.

If the badness metric is modified to use the predictions of the MTF code oracle
and sums up the differences between the entropy codeword lengths of the actual
and ideal MTF codes instead of the differences between the codes themselves, it
is the ideal metric for generating a reordering for only the first column.

Since only the first column gets reordered, recurring symbols within a
context block are fixed and have no influence, good or bad, on the compression
rate. The only thing that can make a difference are the MTF codes of symbols
occurring for the first time in the block. The badness metric records the
difference between the number of bits that are used if the left side of the
transition leaves an ideal alphabet for the right side, and the number of bits
that are actually used.

That way, if the transition (a,b) has a badness of n, and the transition (a,c)
has a badness of n+m, all other transition's badness values being equal, if the
transition (a,c) is used, the result will be m bits larger than if the
transition (a,b) was used.

If the badness values of all possible transitions are provided as input to an
exact TSP solver, it will generate the best possible reordering, for only the
first column of the BW table.

\subsection{Variants}

There are three variants of the badness metric, two of which are attempting to
approximate the predictions of the oracles from the previous section.

\subsubsection{Weighting by number of symbols}



\subsubsection{Predicting MTF codes for new symbols}

\subsubsection{Predicting code lengths of the entropy coder}
