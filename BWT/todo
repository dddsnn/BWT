need to sort the entire BW table with different ordering, encoded chars within a subcode belonging to one letter will be permuted
also analyze transitions within one grouping of the first column (orderings in the second column); worth worrying about? the code letters corresponding to that group would be permuted given a different odering for the second (etc.) columns

inversion coding
overwork
effect of reversed bwt on computing optimized sorts
